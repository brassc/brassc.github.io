    <p>Andrew Scott, Paul Mescal, Claire Foy, Jamie Bell star in this film set in Britain and directed by 
        Andrew Haigh.  I am not a film critic, but the reason I am writing about it is because it made me cry.  A lot.  
        Almost audible sobs in the <em>cinema</em>. Several times, such was the catharsis and tide of emotion.

        Seeing a film set in Britain, with British accents in the Landmark theatre in Palo Alto was odd. 
        Comforting, a sense of national identity and belonging and resonance that one doesn't get from reading 
        about our semi-unelected Prime Minister in the news.

        Alex remarked 'it was brave, but I think he got away with using "The Power of Love". I think.' 
        I'll protect you from the hooded claw, keep the vampires from your door.
