    <h3>Endeavour</h3>
    22/04/2023 <br>
    <p>Let's explore the word.</p>
    <p>'Do. Or do not. There is no try.' Thanks for this, George Lucas. Or as a 
        <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/8-powerful-quotes-from-yoda-the-og-wellness-guru-ce03db397749">Medium post </a>
        put it, 'Yoda [is the] the OG wellness guru'. </p>
    <p> Endeavour. The name of a ship used by James Cook to chart New Zealand and Australia, 1769 - 1771. 
        Endeavour is glorified, but in retrospect doesn't follow a positive path for many, or most.</p>
    <p>Not to be confused with Endurance, Shackleton's 1912 Arctic exploration vessel, lost when it became 
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139069.Endurance">stuck in the ice floes</a>, crushed and abandoned. [1]</p>
    
    <p>So far it seems endeavour is some combination of effort and endurance. And do Americans really spell it endeavor? 
        In Yoda's philisophy, [relating doing or not doing to trying].
