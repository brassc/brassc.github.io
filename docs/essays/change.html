    <h3>I Can't Change</h3>

    <p><em>"Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."</em><sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>The problem with working for an organisation of world repute is similar to being in a relationship with a desirable<sup>2</sup> person 
        who is more powerful than you. 
    </p>
    <p>Regarding the organisation: From the outside looking in, people are generally congratulatory, 'you're so lucky', or even associate you with a 
        certain level on respect that comes from their perception of the organisations achievements. The assumption that Newton's apple doesn't fall far 
        from the tree. </p>

    <p>Yet. If you find yourself not enjoying it, or even suffering through it, <em>enduring</em>, these onlookers may be confused. 
    'Can't you just stick it out?'. Or even, 'people would kill for your job!'. All of which sends the impression that there must 
be something wrong with you. Some weakness of character. </p>

<p>I like to think of myself as a rational being, so following some adverse experiences I've subsequently made the effort to see 
    people, organisations, as they are and accept that. 
</p>
<p>What I have greater difficulty with is accepting the limits of my capacity to change in myself. To be sure, it is within my power to 
    change, in fact I am the only person with the capacity to change myself<sup>3</sup>. However, there are times when the band gap<sup>4</sup> between the higher, 
    ideal self and reality is simply too great, yet I still put a lot of energy into conforming to this fantasy. A fantasy in which I love what I do, or I'm the 
    idea of the perfect partner, the perfect PhD student, as expected by others and also by myself. 
</p>

<p>If I don't like my job, maybe I should stick it out and wait for myself to wake up, one sunny morning, and for me to have so
    perfectly adjusted to my micro-world that causes me to suffer such that I actually now enjoy it! 
</p>

<p>Sometimes I am even able to do this. There are enough good parts in everything to cling to a narrative of positivity, of what 
    'should' work, rather than what is resonating with my soul. Historically I didn't, and sometimes still I don't trust my own resonant frequencies. 
    When did I lose faith in my knowledge of myself? 
</p>
<p>This brings me back to the 'world-reknowned' or 'desirable' portion and the power differential. When you are frequently told 
    to defer to better judgement, how you should behave, or what you should want, and you have subscribed to the idea of what you should want
    and how you should behave, or even that those things are your identity or who you <em>are</em>, it can take a long time to leave. 
    To step back, and listen to your gut. It's taken me a long time to leave situations in which I was unhappy, leaving my PhD is no different. 
    It is not a question of sunk cost <br> fallacy<sup>5 6</sup>. 
     
</p>
<p>I am still working on giving myself grace to accept what is resonating with me. To accept not enough incremental change can happen 
    in this time frame, in others or at an organisational level, but also in myself. Accept that, for now, for this circumstance, the sentence 
    'I can't change'. I cannot will what I will. Accept this and in doing so, accept myself.
