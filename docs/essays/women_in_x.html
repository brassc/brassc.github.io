<p>'How is it, to be a woman in <em>engineering</em>?' </p>
<p>As if I spoke for all women. As if the multitudes embodied in the experiences of all women could be contained in what I had to say. </p>
<p>I usually start with the caveat that I can only speak from my experience. So to answer the question: It is bad. A broad statement, with which other women in engineering largely agree. 
     This is for our own reasons, specific to our own experiences, although these experiences can often overlap. </p>
<p>Why is it bad? How can we make it better? </p>
<p>Let's talk about the minority experience. By this, I don't mean 'I was the only white man in the dumpling restaurant'. 
    I mean minority in the sense that takes into account structural inequality and power heirarchy across gender, race and class<sup>1</sup>. 
    It is very easy to feel isolated when you are the only minority in the room, when the overlap in the Venn diagram of your experience 
    vs. that of other's present is reduced.  </p>
